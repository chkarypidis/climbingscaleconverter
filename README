Introduction
------------

This climbing scale converter allows you to convert from/to 17 grading scales in climbing (lead climbing and bouldering). You can easily include it as a gadget on your website/blog.

Downloading
-----------

You may download this tool from http://climbingscaleconverter.sourceforge.net/

Using the climbing scale converter
----------------------------------

A stand-alone version of this gadget is available in this archive. All you need to do is open the html file with your favourite browser.

An implemented version of this tool can be found on http://climbingscaleconverter.sourceforge.net/ or on my blog: http://onmywayto8a.blogspot.com/

Integrating the converter into your website
-------------------------------------------

* Copy ``convertClimbingScale.js`` in the same directory as the one holding your html file.
* Insert ``<script src="convertClimbingScale.js"></script>`` in the <head> section of your html file. If you decide to put the .js file in another folder, make sure the correct directory is indicated.
* Paste the entire content of the <body> section into your html file. It is up to you to decide where on your page the converter will be displayed.
* If you would like for the input box to receive focus automatically after the page load, include the ``onload="focusOnInput()"`` option in your <body> tag.

Integrating the converter into your blog
----------------------------------------

* Embed the content of the ``convertClimbingScale.js`` file in a ``<script></script>`` environment and place the code anywhere in your code.
* Paste the entire content of the <body> section anywhere on your blog.

Notes
-----

- The equivalence between scales is available in the .ods file. That data is also available in the Javascript code. If you do not agree with a specific equivalence, feel free to modify the JS code directly (see comments within the code).
